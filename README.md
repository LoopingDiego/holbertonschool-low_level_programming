# C language: Low level Programming

This repository contains multiple exercises for understanding how C Language works 

## Badges

## Recomendations

* Projects were checked with gcc 4.8.4 using -Werror -Wall -Wextra -pedantic
* Betty code style is the standard code style for Holberton, you can get [the betty checker here](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki) and documentation about using it in different text editors
* Global variables are not implemented for security reasons
